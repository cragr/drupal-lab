/**
 * @defgroup comment_field_access Comment field access operations
 * @{
 * The comment field access method supports the main entity field access
 * operations, such as 'view' and 'edit', but allows also some more complex
 * comment specific operations. The complexity derives from the fact that the
 * comment field is mixing the actions of viewing and posting when is placed as
 * an entity display component.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\comment\CommentFieldItemList::access()
 *
 * The comment field access supports the following operations:
 *
 * @section view 'view'
 * Used to check the access when the field is placed on an entity view display.
 * Even if it's a standard entity field access operation, this is a composite
 * operation as involves in the same time viewing the list of existing comments
 * and accessing the post comment form beneath. This is a standard core
 * operation as is used typically when the field is a visible component of a
 * commented entity view display.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\Core\Entity\Entity\EntityViewDisplay::buildMultiple()
 *
 * @section create 'create'
 * Used to check whether the user can post comments. This operation is mainly
 * used to check the access to the comment form or to a page where the form is
 * located, if the field is configured to place the form on a different page.
 * Note that, the operation of replying to an existing comment is
 * 'reply to {comment id}', rather than 'create'.
 *
 * @section reply_to 'reply to {comment id}'
 * Used to check the access to a form that allows to post a reply to an existing
 * comment, with ID {comment id}. This operation is almost the same as 'create'
 * but unlike the later, the operation name contains also the parent comment ID,
 * providing rich context when the access decision is made. Is used typically to
 * check the access of the reply form route.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\comment\Controller\CommentController::replyFormAccess()
 *
 * @section view_only 'view only'
 * Unlike 'view', this operation limit its scope only to view the field list
 * of comments. Such an operation will be allowed only if the user can access at
 * least one comment from the thread. This is typically used to assemble the
 * access check for 'view', as the later is a composite operation but also in
 * other places, like comment_node_search_result(), where the number of comments
 * is attached to the nodes search result and we need to check if the user is
 * able to view the comments.
 *
 * @section edit 'edit'
 * This is a standard entity operation that allows access to the comment field
 * widget in the commented entity form.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\Core\Entity\Entity\EntityFormDisplay::buildForm()
