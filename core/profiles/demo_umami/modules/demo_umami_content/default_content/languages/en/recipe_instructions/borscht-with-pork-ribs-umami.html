  <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Put pork ribs on the baking dish and bake them within 30 min. Wash the celery root, but don’t peel it. Take the carrot and it is in medium pieces.</li>
  <li>Put baked pork ribs in a pot and pour 3 liters of water there. Add cut celery root and carrot along with the not peeled onion half. Bring the pot to a boiling condition. After that, make a medium heat and continue boiling for 30min.</li>
  <li>The heart of the borscht is pre-roasted vegetables. Dice bell pepper and do the same with tomatoes and onion. Place the butter on a saucepan and add vegetables. Cook them over moderate heat to soften vegetables, after that add two tbsp of tomato paste, reduce the heat and keep on stewing them for 5-7 minutes. Also, grate a beet and put it in the saucepan too and stew them all together for 3-4 more minutes.</li>
  <li>Cut a garlic bulb in a half and add it to the pot. Shred the cabbage and put it aside, we will add it later.</li>
  <li>We need beet juice, so take the second beet and squeeze all juices out. If you don’t have a juice squeezer, you can grate a beet and squeeze it through the sieve. Then add the juice together with allspice, bay leaves, and several pinches of salt (to your taste).</li>
  <li>You can also add canned beans: it is an optional addition.</li>
  <li>Put smoked pears in a pot. They will make your dish smell smoky.</li>
  <li>Congratulations, our borscht is almost ready. Now you can add shredded cabbage and within five minutes you can put the pot aside from the heat. Put borscht away for 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serve borscht together with a spoon of sour cream and chopped dill. Put the rest of the borscht in a fridge and remember that it tastes better the next day.</p>
